and Empirical Rule - 

Probability of the Values in a Normal Distribution - 68, 95, 99.7 Rule

Z-Score = (individual data value - population mean) / population standard deviation

Z-Score at Mean = 0
Z-Score at Mean + 1 S.D. = +1
Z-Score at Mean - 1 S.D. = -1
Z-Score at Mean + 2 S.D. = +2
Z-Score at Mean - 2 S.D. = -2


Correlation - qualitative assessment

Covariance - quantifies how change in one variable relates to changes in another.
